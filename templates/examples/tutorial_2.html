<p>Please make sure you have everything installed before the workshop.</p>

  </p>
</li>

this tutorial</a>. 
    Get comfortable. This is your new tool. </p>
    <p>If you have Windows, download 
    <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">
    Git for Windows
    </a>
    . When you get to the
    "Adjusting your Path Environment Option", leave the default option
    selected: "Use Git Bash only". Keep everything else as the default
    options. Once installed, open the Git Bash shell, and this will work
    similar to a Mac or Linux command line.</p>
